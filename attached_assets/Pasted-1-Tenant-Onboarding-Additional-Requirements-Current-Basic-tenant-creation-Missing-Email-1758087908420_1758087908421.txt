1. Tenant Onboarding - Additional Requirements
Current: Basic tenant creation
Missing:
- 📧 Email verification & welcome flows ==> no need for now, just put a placeholder if I need it in the future
- 💳 Billing/subscription tier setup ==> It's gonna be a per module monthly/annual subscription for now, with a plan to be a per module and per user monthly/annual subscription. Trial period is also allowed, free of charge.
- 🌍 Localization (timezone, currency, language) ==> agree
- 🔐 Security policies (password rules, 2FA setup) ==> no need for now
- 📊 Initial data setup (sample data, guided setup wizard) ==> sample data for dev purposes yes, but not for production. There's gonna be a data setup for each module, but not for tenant onboarding other than general info.
- 🔗 Default integrations (email provider, payment gateway)  ==> put a placeholder for it now, i dont see the need now
- 📋 Compliance setup (data retention, privacy settings) ==> this is a tenant setup, defined by the tenant, not needed during onboarding.

2. Tenant Admin Dashboard - Enhanced Capabilities
Current: Basic user/role management + module subscription
Missing:
- 👥 User lifecycle (invite, onboard, deactivate, password reset) ==> no invite needed, create, deactivate, password reset only
- 📈 Usage analytics & reporting ==> not needed now, put a placeholder for this.
- 🔧 Module configuration & customization ==> this is gonna be on the module level, so not needed now.
- 📤 Data import/export tools ==> this is gonna be on the module level, so not needed now.
- 🔔 Notification & alert management ==> agree, based on events defined.
- 📋 Audit logs & compliance reporting ==> audit logs only, filtered by date, type, module, etc.
- 🔄 Backup & disaster recovery ==> backup and restore data only. data is saved on the tenant admin's pc, not at the server level
- 💰 Billing & invoice management  ==> in susbcription management

3. Integration & Event Management
Current: Interface creation (inbound/outbound/webhook)
Missing:
- 🔌 Pre-built integration marketplace  ==> integration is a module that can be subscribed, tenant admin can create API key for their partners, active/deactive partners, for outbound define the end point, api key required, and payload definition for a certain webhook.
- 📡 Real-time event streaming  ==> yes, through event subscription
- 🔄 Data synchronization workflows ==> not needed
- 📊 Integration monitoring & health checks ==> agree
- 🔒 API key & security management ==> defined in each integration point
- 📝 Integration documentation & testing tools ==> yes, in each outbound/webhook integration point

🏗️ Technical Architecture Gaps
Database Schema Extensions Needed:
Subscription Management: Plans, billing cycles, usage limits ==> agree
Event System: Audit trails, webhooks, notifications ==> agree
Configuration Storage: Tenant settings, module configs ==> tenants setting only, module config only for activate/deactivate a module.
Integration Registry: Connected services, API credentials ==> at tenant level.

API Layer Enhancements:
Tenant Provisioning APIs: Automated onboarding workflows ==> just a simple add new tenants, filling in the required info, and create the tenant admin user and password. resetting tenant admin password also.
Module Marketplace APIs: Browse, subscribe, configure modules ==> agree, configure module is only activate/deactivate module
Integration APIs: Connect external services ==> at tenant level
Analytics APIs: Usage metrics, reporting ==> agree

Business Logic Components:
Billing Engine: Subscription management, usage tracking ==> agree
Event System: Audit logging, webhook delivery ==> agree
Notification Service: Email, SMS, in-app notifications ==> in app notification only for now.
Configuration Manager: Dynamic settings, feature flags ==> not needed for now.

"Test that module hotswap operations complete without affecting ongoing user sessions"
```

### Error Handling
```
"Test that the system handles database connection failures gracefully and shows user-friendly error messages"

"Verify that form validation prevents invalid data entry and shows helpful error messages"

"Test that broken modules don't crash the entire system and proper fallbacks are shown"
```

## üéØ Business Workflow Examples

### End-to-End Car Dealership
```
"Simulate a complete customer journey: browsing vehicles, scheduling test drive, negotiating price, completing purchase, scheduling delivery"

"Test the sales reporting workflow: generate monthly sales report, filter by salesperson, export to CSV"

## üí° Tips for Business Analysts

### Writing Effective Tests
- Use specific, measurable criteria (exact text, numbers, timeframes)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test real business scenarios that your customers will encounter
- Verify data flows between different parts of the system

### Common Test Patterns
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete for all business entities
- **Workflow Testing**: Complete business processes from start to finish
- **Validation Testing**: Ensure business rules are enforced
- **Integration Testing**: Verify modules work together correctly

### Best Practices
- Test with realistic data that matches your business
- Include edge cases (empty lists, maximum values, unusual inputs)
- Verify user permissions and access controls
- Test on both desktop and mobile views

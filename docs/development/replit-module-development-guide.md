# Replit Business Analyst Module Development Guide

## Overview

This guide shows how business analysts can use Replit with AI coding tools to develop business modules on the plugin-based foundation. The combination of Replit's environment and AI assistance enables domain experts to build production-ready modules without deep technical knowledge.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Developing a New Module on Replit

### Option A: Personal Business Analyst Environment

**Step 1: Get Your Personal Replit Fork**
```
1. Admin provides you with a personal foundation fork
2. Access your Replit environment - foundation already configured
3. AI coding assistant (Cursor, GitHub Copilot) pre-installed
4. Environment ready for business module development
```

**Step 2: Describe Your Business Requirement**
```
1. Open chat with AI assistant
2. Describe your business module in plain English:
   "I need to track customer loyalty points for a car dealership"
3. AI suggests module structure and implementation approach
```

**Step 3: Generate Module with AI Assistance**
```bash
# AI helps you run the module generator
npx tsx tools/module-generator/generate-module.ts loyalty Customer

# AI explains what each generated file does
# AI suggests customizations based on your requirements
```

**Step 4: Customize Business Logic with AI**
```
1. Edit files in: src/modules/loyalty/
2. Use AI to implement specific business rules:
   - "Add bonus points for service appointments"
   - "Create VIP tier for customers with 1000+ points"
   - "Generate monthly loyalty reports"
3. AI writes the code, you provide the business logic
```

### Option B: Importing from GitHub

**Step 1: Import Foundation from GitHub**
```
1. Go to replit.com
2. Click "Create Repl"
3. Select "Import from GitHub"
4. Enter your foundation repository URL
5. Replit automatically sets up the project
```

**Step 2: Configure Replit Environment**
```bash
# Replit automatically runs:
npm install
npm run dev

# If needed, manually run database setup:
npm run db:push
```

**Step 3: Create Feature Branch**
```bash
# Use Replit's Git pane or Shell:
git checkout -b feature/inventory-module
```

git merge feature/customer-portal
```

### 3. Replit Development Environment

**Live Preview for Module Testing:**
```
1. Your module runs automatically at: https://[repl-name].[username].repl.co
2. Test your module's routes: /console/[module-name]
3. Preview updates in real-time as you code
4. Use browser dev tools for debugging
```

**Database Management:**
```bash
# Database runs automatically on Replit
# Check database status:
npm run db:push --dry-run

npm run db:push

# View database (if configured):
# Use Replit's database viewers or connect external tools
```

### 4. Environment Variables & Secrets

**Setting Up Module Secrets:**
```
1. Click "Secrets" tab in left sidebar
2. Add any module-specific environment variables
3. These sync with your generated module automatically
4. ⚠️  Remember: Join link shares secrets!
```

**Common Module Environment Variables:**
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (auto-configured)
NODE_ENV=development
[MODULE_NAME]_API_KEY=your-external-api-key
[MODULE_NAME]_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
```

## Conclusion

Replit makes module development incredibly smooth by removing environment setup barriers and enabling real-time collaboration. The combination of our plugin architecture and Replit's collaborative features allows distributed teams to build business modules efficiently without stepping on each other's work.

The key is to leverage Replit's strengths (real-time collaboration, instant environment) while respecting our architecture's boundaries (module isolation, foundation protection).
